# BaseReductor

This is a filter plugin for the [Glyphs font editor](http://glyphsapp.com/). After installation, it will add the menu item *Filter > BaseReductor.* You can set a keyboard shortcut in System Preferences. The filter will reduce diacritics to their base glyphs, e.g. `äáàāą` will appear as `aaaa`. This can be useful for trial fonts.
